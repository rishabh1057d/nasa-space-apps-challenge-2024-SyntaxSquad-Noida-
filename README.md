# Brief of the Prototype

This project is an intelligent irrigation advisory system that uses real-time weather data and machine learning to help farmers make informed irrigation decisions. The solution features a chatbot interface that interacts with farmers in a simple, conversational manner. Farmers can ask about the weather, rainfall predictions, or irrigation needs, and the chatbot provides real-time responses. It uses machine learning models to predict rain and estimate precipitation, combining this data with information about soil and crop types to deliver personalized irrigation recommendations.

Key Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches live weather data using the Meteomatics API.
Machine Learning Insights: Uses Random Forest models to predict rain and precipitation levels.
User-Friendly Interaction: The chatbot provides easy access to weather and irrigation advice without needing technical knowledge.
This chatbot-based system empowers farmers to make better irrigation decisions, conserve water, and improve crop yieldsâ€”all through an easy-to-use chat interface.
